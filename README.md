GRX 3
=====

GRX 3 is a graphics library for simple graphics displays. It also includes
keyboard, mouse, joystick and touchscreen input support.

It is developed and maintained by [ev3dev.org](http://www.ev3dev.org) for use
with [LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3](http://mindstorms.lego.com). It also works great
with other displays like Adafruit's PiTFT displays.


About/FAQ
---------

Why revive an old graphics library instead of using a "modern" library like SDL?

* Other libraries do not handle 1-bit-per-pixel displays (at least not very well).
  LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 has a monochrome display, so this is a necessity.
* Other libraries rely on floating point heavily. GRX 3 uses integers mostly.
  This is important for performance because LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 does not have
  a hardware floating point processor.

Why use GLib?

* Using GLib allows other programming languages to use this library with minimal
  effort using [GObject Introspection].

What OSes does it run on?

* Currently, it runs on Linux and macOS.

History
-------

GRX was originally written in the 1990s by Csaba Biegl for
DJ Delorie's DOS port of the GCC compiler.

[GRX 2.x](http://grx.gnu.de/) was actively maintained until about 2012 and was
ported to many different platforms.
