This is a (far from complete) list of people who sent me ideas, bug reports
or useful code pieces during the development of GRX 2.0.

This file is under construction (I need to go back in my e-mail records to
see who sent me bug reports, ideas, etc...). Currently it has only the most
recent contributions. If you think you sent me something for which you should
be mentioned here, but you don't see your name in the list, drop me an e-mail.
I may have lost same of the older correspondence.

Ulrich Leodolter (ulrich@lab1.psy.univie.ac.at) for the wonderful X11
video, frame and font drivers, bug reports and the DOS Hercules video
