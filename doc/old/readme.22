Hi,

the official public release GRX v2.2 is available from

   http://www.techfak.uni-kiel.de/~hsc/GRX/grx22.zip

and soon from any SimTel mirror in the DJGPP/v2tk
directory.

Thanks to a lot of work by

   Csaba Biegl  (csaba@vuse.vanderbilt.edu)

of course and

   Mauro Condarelli (mc5686@mclink.it)
   Christian Domp   (alma.student.uni-kl.de)
   Michael Goffioul (goffioul@emic.ucl.ac.be)
   Sven Hilscher    (Sven@rufus.central.de)

   Ulrich Leodolter (ulrich@lab1.psy.univie.ac.at)
   Hartmut Schirmer (hsc@techfak.uni-kiel.de)
   Daniel Skarda    (0rfelyus@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz)

and others (see doc/credits.doc) the GRX library is now
greatly enhanced.


Compared with the grx20.zip from DJ-dirs this release provides:
---------------------------------------------------------------
  - user coordinates (by Michael)
  - pattern filling (by Michael)
  - custom lines (by Michael)
  - Linux support [svgalib && X11 (Ulrich) support and other
		   things Csaba mentions in credits.doc      ]
  - reorganized font support (Csaba)
  - linkable bitmap fonts (Csaba)
  - Borland vector fonts (Csaba)
  - VESA 2.0 and svgalib linear frame buffer support
  - VESA 2.0 8bit DAC support
  - various driver speed ups
  - slightly changed color interface (by Michael for better
    MGUI support)
  - GNU-Pascal support (by Sven)


What's currently untested:
--------------------------
  - LFB32H frame driver
  - svgalib linear frame buffer support
  - X11 driver is supposed to work but couldn't test this
  - svgalib/X11 on non i386 platforms


What's missing:
---------------
  - documentation
  - VESA 2.0 protected mode virtual screen support


Installation for DJGPP:
-----------------------
  Unpack the grx22.zip archive in your DJGPP v2 root directory
  by 'pkunzip -d grx22.zip' or 'unzip grx22.zip'

  Edit your DJGPP.ENV file.
    a. delete all references to GRX v2.0 or v2.1
    b. In the [cpp] section append
	  ;%DJDIR%/contrib/grx22/include
       to C_INCLUDE_PATH and CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH variables
    c. In the [gcc] section append
	  ;%DJDIR%/contrib/grx22/lib
       to the LIBRARY_PATH entry
    d. GNU-Pascal users need to change [gpc-cpp] and
       [gpc] sections too.
    e. Make sure the GRXFONT environment variable is set,
       otherwise add
	 +GRXFONT=%DJDIR%/contrib/grx22/fonts
       at top of DJGPP.ENV

  Check GRX v2.2
    a. go to DJDIR/contrib/grx22 and check makedefs.gnu and
       makedefs.dj2 for your system requirements (default
       should work well on average system )
    b. go to the test subdir and build the test files:
	 make -f makefile.dj2
    c. run the tests

  Recompile your own programs with GRX v2.2!


Installation for Linux:
-----------------------
  Unpack the grx22.zip archive in a temporary directory
  using  'unzip -L -a grx22.zip'. Make sure all .fnt
  files where extracted in binary mode! Go to contrib
  subdir and move the grx22 tree to /usr/src

  Delete the DJGPP .a file in the grx22/lib subdir.

  Many GRX based programs need to access the font file.
  Either make the /usr/src/grx22/fonts subdir readable
  to anyone running GRX programs or copy the fonts subdir
  to a place where anyone can access it (I placed the
  fonts in /usr/local/grx-fonts on my system)
  Make sure the GRXFONT environment variable points to
  the fonts directory.

  In /usr/src/grx22 check the default settings in
  makedefs.gnu and makedefs.x11

  To build the SVGALIB based GRX v2.2 run
    make -f makefile.lnx

  To build the X11 based GRX v2.2 run
    make -f makefile.x11

  Check the by running the (static linked) test programs.

  If everything works well, copy the .a and .so library
  files to a system lib dir, eg. /usr/local/lib and
  generate symbolic links for the shared libraries:
	 libgrx20.so  -> libgrx20.so.2.2.0
	 libgrx20X.so -> libgrx20X.so.2.2.0

  Copy the files from grx22/include and grx22/compat to
  an include dir (eg. /usr/local/include)

  Make sure all installed files are readable everyone
  compiling/running GRX based programs.

  Now GRX v2.2 should be ready for your programs !


Important:
----------

  Due to slight changes in grx20.h you'll have to recompile
  your programs. Just relinking it won't work in most cases.


Help:
-----
If you find a bug in GRX v2.2, if GRX doesn't work on
your system or if you have any other question concerning
GRX, please contact me by e-mail:
