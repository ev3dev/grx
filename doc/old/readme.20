Introduction
------------

This is an updated (beta) version of the GRX v2.0 graphics library.

New features are :

	- Pattern Filled functions

		ex.: GrPatternFilledCircle(xc,yc,r,p);

	- Patterned Line functions

		ex.: GrPatternedCircle(xc,yc,r,lp);

	- Custom Line functions

		ex.: GrCustomLine(x1,y1,x2,y2,lo);

	- User Coordinates functions

		ex.: GrUsrFilledEllipse(xc,yc,xa,ya,c);

These features have been ported to GRX v2.0 from previous versions
in the GRX v1.03. However some functions had to be entirely rewritten
for compatibility with the new version of the library.

For more informations on these functions, see the documentation located
in the 'doc/' subdirectory, or edit the 'grx20.h' file to see how to use
the functions.


Library
-------

A compiled version of the library (with Djgpp v2.01) is supplied with
this upgrade and is located in the lib/ subdirectory as the 'libgrx20.a'
file. The file 'libgrx20.bk2' also present is a backup of the library
of the previous version of GRX20 (without the new features).

The library can be recompiled by 'make' in the root directory :

	make libs

If you don't want these new features, you can compile the previous
version of the library with the command line

	make previous

In case of bugs, this can be useful.

After compiling the library, you can clean the directory (by deleting
all the objects files in the 'src/' subdirectory with the command line

	make clean

so you keep only the archive file on your disk. It can save a little
amount of memory.


Installing
----------

With the line command

	make install

in the root directory of GRX20 'make' will copy the include files in the
'include/' directory of DJGPP and the library file in the 'lib/' directory.


Testing
-------

For compiling the tests programs, just type the line command

	make test

This will compile the library and the tests programs supplied in the
'test/' subdirectory of GRX20. These tests are those supplied with the
previous version. No tests are already available for the new features
of the library. But testing these shouldn't be very difficult ...

Check your bookmarks, maybe I can release some tests soon !


Conclusion
----------

I have not completely tested the library, but it passed all the tests
I made on it (and there were a lot of tests). However, if you encounter
some problems in using these new functions, you may contact me at this
address :
	      goffioul@emic.ucl.ac.be

Please send the most reduced code which shows the bug with your message,
so I can test it for myself.

I hope you'll enjoy these new features which I missed sometimes (and
I think I was not the only one ...).
