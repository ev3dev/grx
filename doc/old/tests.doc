Introduction
============

This document gives a brief description of the test programs in the
'tests' sub-directory.

The test programs were not intended as a flashy demo of the capabilities
of LIBGRX. Their purpose is to test the various services of the library.
The general syntax of their usage is:

    go32 <prog> [<width> <height> [<color>]] <additional arguments>
		    -- or for the Turbo C tests --
    <prog> [<width> <height> [<color>]] <additional arguments>

The test programs typically display several screens, hitting any key
will advance to the next screen. In a few cases the keyboard is used
differently, these programs will be described below.


Description of the test programs:
=================================

    MODETEST:
	perform video adapter speed test and test the basic primitives
	of the library.

    WINTEST, WINCLIP, CLIPTEST:
	test graphics contexts sub-contexts and clipping

    FRAMTEST:
	demo of the framed box primitive

    BLITTEST:
	test the bit block transfer function. First it tests the bitblt
	primitive for 64 possible alignment cases in planar modes (8
	possible alignments for the source and destination each). It does
	this test both for forward and backward copy (it depends on
	whether the source address is bigger than the destination) and
	for a system RAM graphics context source. A wide and a narrow
	test pattern is used. After finishing the basic tests the program
	gives a demo of tiling the screen with a pattern similar to the
	one in FRAMTEST.

    RGBTEST:
	tests the 256 color RGB mode.

    COLOROPS:
	tests the four write modes: SET, XOR, OR, AND

    CURSTEST:
	tests the graphics cursor drawing routines, Keyboard usage:
	   u U		(up)		\
	   d D		(down)		  move the cursor
	   l L		(left)		  capitals faster
	   r R		(right)		/
	   q				exit program

    MOUSETST:
	test the mouse cursor and the rubberband cursor options.

    POLYTEST:
	test the polygon filling algorithm. It takes the coordinates
	of the polygons from the data file "polytest.dat"

    CIRCTEST:
	test the circle drawing algorithm with a circle, horizontal and
	vertical main axis ellipse. It draws the exact points (calculated
	using FP arithmetics) in red. The 'q' key aborts the test.

    TESTPATT:
	tests the pattern filled graphics primitives.


NOTE: these programs can also be used as examples for the usage of the
library. As always: CONSULT THE SOURCE!!!!
