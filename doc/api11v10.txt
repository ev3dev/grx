There are some important changes in the MGRX 1.1 API over MGRX 1.0 that require
changing the source code. These are:

1- To acomodate the new extended internationalization support the GR_ATTR_TEXT
   chrtype was deleted, so if your program depends on it you can't update to
   MGRX 1.1, sorry.

2- The GrTextRegion and functions were deleted too, because its use is very
   connected to the GR_ATTR_TEXT chrtype.

3- Now GrTextOption.fgcv and GrTextOption.bgcv are GrColor values, not unions,
   so you must change constructions like "grt->fgcv.v = color" by
   "grt->fgcv = color". The same for bgcv.

4- Replaced GrGetKbEncoding and GrSetKbEncoding functions with GrGetUserEncoding
   and GrSetUserEncoding, these functions exists even if not input driver is
   ebabled (like with the memory driver). User enconding default to GRENC_UTF_8
   in linux and X11, GRENC_PC437 in DJGPP and GRENC_PC1252 in WIn32, but the
   programmer can set it like he wants. Now key events are recoded to the user
   encoding.

5- Deleted the GrProportionalTextWidth function because GrFontStringWidth works
   for both proportional and fixed fonts.

6- Replaced the GrDefaultFont define by two functions GrGetDefaultFont and
   GrSetDefaultFont, now you can set the default font that you want (set to 
   built-in GrFont_PC8x14 by default).
