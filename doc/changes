           x86_64 platforms. Backport from GRX 2.4.7 (M.Lombardi).
2007-11-07 Simplify the include/arith.h code.
2007-06-09 ----------- mGRX 0.9.7 released
2007-06-03 The djgpp delay function doesn't work on WinXP and W2000. It is
           corrected in the djgpp CVS version. We included the source for the
           new delay in src/misc. When a new djgpp version will be released
           this source code will be removed.
2007-06-01 The X11 driver now uses a pixmap for backin store and responds to
           Expose events. But it is a bit slowly. If you want a faster driver
           edit src/include/libxwin.h and set USE_PIXMAP_FOR_BS to 0.
2007-06-01 GrEventRead now waits 1 msec if no event is ready, so now MGRX
           programs doesn't load the cpu 100%.
2007-06-01 GrSleep calls XFlush in the X11 platform, to flush the graphics
           queue before wait.

2006-02-17 ----------- mGRX 0.9.4 released
2006-02-10 Better understanding of x86_64. Now by default an i386
           library is built even on x86_64 platforms. If you set
           BUILD_X86_64 to 'y' in makdefs.grx a x86_64 library is
           built, and the install target go to the lib64 subdir
