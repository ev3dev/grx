Pascal (GPC) demo Programs

graph.pas is the unit import file, as far as possible a plug-in
replacement for the BP unit of the same name
(see doc/readme.bgi for differences)

* small.pas opens and closes the graphics to check for improper installation.
* modelist.pas prints out the available modes.
* palette.pas prints out the colors in the default palette.
* allmodes.pas for each available mode prints out mode number and its parameters
   and displays one color rainbow.
* colors.pas for each avalaible mode with nc>=256 prints out mode name
   and displays red, green, blue gray degraded stripes.
* demo.pas displays various demos to illustrate graphics possibilities. 
   It supposes for some of them that borland .chr files have been put in 
   the chr directory (otherwise it uses the always available default font).
   
Makefiles are supplied to build up the demo programs for 
djgpp, mingw32, LINUX/svga and LINUX/X11.
They should have been built with the library and C tests if you
used the top level makefiles.
If you want to rebuild only the demos type from this dir
   make -f <your makefile>
Pathes and parameters will be borrowed from corresponding top level
makedefs files

Have fun!
