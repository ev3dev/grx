Welcome to the wonderful world of GRX for pascal-users.
=======================================================

If you are interested in GNU-Pascal (gpc), visit
http://gnu-pascal.de/gpc/h-index.html
There is a mailinglist available.

This directory contains several test-programs for GRX
and GNU-Pascal.

* blt_test.pas draws some circles
* modetest.pas prints out the available modes
* keytest.pas prints out the character-codes. Use "Q" to quit.
* txt_test.pas prints out some text. Press Return to exit.
* vir_test.pas lets you draw something.
  Press "1", to place some sqares with the mouse.
  Press "2" to draw some lines
  Press "3" to copy some drawings from one place to another
    ("<" and ">" change the size of your "copy-area")
  Press "4" to draw whatever you like :-)
  Press "0" to leave drawing-mode
  "Q" leaves vir_test.
* polytest.pas draws some polygons
* jpgtest.pas loads/saves jpeg images
* imgview.pas loads png and jpeg images
* colortst.pas tests allocating many colors

To build up the programs, either

- use the generic makefile and edit the paths, then type
   make 

- For djgpp, mingw32, LINUX/svga and LINUX/X11, sdl, they should 
have been built with the library and C tests from top level makefile,
if you used them. 
If you want to rebuild only the tests type from this dir
   make -f <your makefile>
Pathes and parameters will be borrowed from corresponding top level
makedefs files

Have fun!
