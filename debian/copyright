License: GRX
 This document describes the terms for distributing the source code of and any
 derived work based on the GRX graphics library. Such source code is marked
 with the next text:
 .
 ** Copyright (c) [year] [author], [author information]
 **
 ** This file is part of the GRX graphics library.
 **
 ** The GRX graphics library is free software; you can redistribute it
 ** and/or modify it under some conditions; see the "copying.grx" file
 ** for details.
 .
 Source code with the above copyright is distributed under the following terms:
 .
  (1) The test programs for the graphics library (code in the 'test'
      sub-directory) is distributed without restrictions. This code
      is free for use in commercial, shareware or freeware applications.
 .
  (2) The GRX graphics library is distributed under the terms of the
      GNU LGPL (Library General Public License) with the following amendments
      and/or exceptions:
 .
      -  Using the DOS versions (DOS only! this exception DOES NOT apply to
         the Linux version) you are permitted to distribute an application
         linked with GRX in binary only, provided that the documentation
         of the program:
 .
            a) informs the user that GRX is used in the program, AND
 .
            b) provides the user with the necessary information about
               how to obtain GRX. (i.e. ftp site, etc..)
 .
  (3) Fonts (in the 'fonts' directory) are distributed according to the
      terms in the file "COPYING.MIT". Most of the fonts included with the
      GRX library were derived from fonts in the MIT X11R4 distribution.
      The exception is the "pc" BIOS font family, which is distributed
      without restrictions.
 .
 A copy of the GNU GPL (in the file "COPYING") and the GNU LGPL (in
 the file "COPYING.LIB") is included with this document. If you did
 not receive a copy of "COPYING" or "COPYING.LIB", you may obtain one 
 from where this document was obtained, or by writing to:

Copyright: See Below
License: MIT/X11
 Software in this distribution of the X Window System is covered by copyrights;
 see the file LABELS in this directory for a list.
 .
 The MIT distribution of the X Window System is publicly available, but is NOT
 in the public domain.  The difference is that copyrights granting rights for
 unrestricted use and redistribution have been placed on all of the software to
 identify its authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to take this software and
 build commerical products.
 .
 Individuals or organizations wishing to contribute software to the public
 releases should use a copyright notice that is no more restrictive than 
 the sample given below.  In particular, 
 .
      o  Do not place any restictions on what can be done with this software
         (this includes using the GNU "copyleft").
 .
      o  Do not include the words "All rights reserved" unless you have had a 
         lawyer verify that you have also explicitly given away all of the 
         necessary rights shown in the samples.
 .
      o  Spell out the word "Copyright"; the phrase "(c)" is NOT a legal
         alternative to the c-in-circle symbol.
 .
      o  Put at least a one-line copyright at the top of EVERY source file, if
         not the full copyright.  Also, the copyright line or full notice MUST
         physically appear in each file.  Using the preprocessor to #include the
         copyright from some other file has no legal meaning (it can be used to
         incorporate common strings into the binary, but has no effect on the
         status of the source code).
 .
      o  Things that are copyrighted are, by definition, not in the public
         domain.
 .
 A copyright notice similar to the following is strongly recommended (replacing
 MIT with your organization's name and putting your name and address at the
 bottom).
